We are Abhishek Panchal, Anushka Barthwal, Shweata Hegde and Tanvi Saxena, four Young India Fellows who are climate nerds, gamers and pop culture experts. Combining our expertise in research, communication, psychology, and sociology, we have developed Pralay---a game where you get to have fun while immersing yourself in the science and politics of climate change. Yes, we are aware that human-induced climate change is a serious problem humanity currently faces. But we want you to take a break from information overload and anxiety-inducing doomsday stories. While it is important to be grounded in reality, sometimes fear makes you resist information. Research shows that games are a better way of engaging with scientific and political nuances of climate change and inoculate yourself from misinformation. We hope that the game becomes a fight-starter at your next family or friends get-together!
